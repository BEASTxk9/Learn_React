## React is a libary for building user interfaces ##

- React runs on the client as a SPA(Single Page App), but can be used to build full stack apps by communicating with a server/API

- React is often referred to as a front-end "framework" because it is capable and directly comparable to a framework such as Vue or Angular.

- Interactive UIs and Virtual DOM(document object module){basically it does things without refreshing eg. delete item without refreshing a page}

- Performance & Testing
